                       For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple products, i have found a new lifestyle thanks 
                       to Apple. And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected
                       with steve. I do hope he will be remembered around the world as a genius.

                    <p class="text">My thoughts and prayers are with you all tonight. The company Steve started has 
                        touched the lives of many in this world and he will be missed. I know he will live on in spirit, 
                        though the lives of all who knew him well. As a sign of respect for Steve, I will be turning my iPhone, 
                        iPod, and iPad off for one hour. May Steve rest in peace.

                    <h1 class="message">Steve Jobs</h1>
                    <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I’ve written as an adult (and certainlyevery one
                         that has been published), almost every email I’ve ever written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online
                          using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of 
                          as a kid. And though his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You’ll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>

                        him.
                        I will forever remember him. I’m still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only
                        imagine
                        his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel.
